# TODO
* [ ] Differential privacy literature review
* [ ] Simulation study differential privacy (show why the mean does not work)
* [ ] Create metric for how much noise is being added
* [ ] Create a privacy framework where the data is *not* fixed, but that the 
framework reduces (maybe in expectation) to differential privacy as a specific 
case.
